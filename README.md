This is simple website build with gatsby.
Its a practice project i used in smearing my skills in React.

started by setting up a Gatsby project and learning the fundamentals. From there, I was able to create Gatsby pages and load dynamic content to my site.

I practice different ways of styling a Gatsby site. In addition to global styling, I also covered how I can scope my component styles locally using the CSS Modules to avoid the risk of name conflicts with any CSS selector.

After that, I learned how to set up a basic SEO for my Gatsby site. And lastly, learned how to deploy my site to Netlify.
